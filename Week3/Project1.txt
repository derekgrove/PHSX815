Pseudo code explaining how my program will work, approximately.
*thoughts, I want to make a probablity distribution that is that of a particle collision, maybe e- + e+ -> muons, gamma, etc.

define defualt collision energy;
define default number of experiments;
Define a probability distribution here{
    calculate expected results of collisions based on energy;
    split range from 0 - 1 into 4 slices, each slice's range is dependent on the distribution calculated above;   
}

add in functionality to take arguments from terminal to change collision energy;
add in functionality to take arguments from terminal to change number of experiments;



for number of experiments {
generate a random number between 0 and 1, compare to our above distribution, return the verdict (muon, gamma, etc.)
 (probably have the verdict returned as 0, 1, 2, 3... where 1 = muon, 2 = gamma, etc. reason for this is to make later analysis easier, analyzing ints instead of strings like "muon", "gamma", etc.)
}

End program one _____________________________________________

In another file, our analysis program:

code here to bring in .txt file as our input;
pass the data from .txt file into an array;

generate histogram, make number of bins = number of results possible from my previously defined distribution, use plot parameters to name the bins "muon", "gamma", etc.;
start iterating through the array, filling each bin;
show.plot;
