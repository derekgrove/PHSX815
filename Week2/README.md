For HW 4 just run the CookieAnalysis.py file and pass it whatever .txt file you want with data, for instance, cookdata.txt

Uhhhhh, also I'm pretty confident I did not do the quartiles correctly, I split the array into even intervals based on index, so if my array is 1000 long I have quartile 1 at index 250, quartile 2 at index 500, etc. 

I print the y-value at that index as the quartile 1, i.e. print(times[q1x])
