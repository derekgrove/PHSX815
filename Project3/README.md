To run this program please have ROOT installed on your computer. 

Ok, navigate to the directory where max_likelihood.cpp is located then launch the root interactive environment. Load the program with ".L max_likelihood.cpp", then run the program by issueing the command "run_experiments()". This will output the results to the terminal, the results you get should be consistent with what I have summarized in the latex writeup.

Thanks!
