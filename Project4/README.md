To run this program please have ROOT installed on your computer.

Ok, navigate to the directory where simulation.cpp is located then launch the root interactive environment. Load the program with ".L simulation.cpp", then run the program by issueing the command "simulation()". This will output the results to the terminal, the results you get should be consistent with what I have summarized in the latex writeup. Also this will overwrite the fit.png image in the directory, however thats ok, its just some formatting adjustements. The original is preserved in the pdf writeup.

Thanks!
